# Simon-Game
Simon Game is a popular memory-based game that challenges players to remember and repeat a series of randomly generated patterns of colors and sounds. The game progressively becomes more difficult as the sequence length increases. The objective is to see how far the player can remember and replicate the patterns correctly.
